                <h3>Game Reviews:</h3>
                <p>The Untitled goose game is rated 8/10 on IGN Africa, 5/5 on Common Sense Media and 81% Metacritic.
                    It has a 4.7 star rating on Google and some of the revies include:
                <br> <br>
                'There really isn't much to say about Untitled Goose Game other than the fact that you should absolutely play it.
                 You're aptly put in control of a goose, however the game isn't strictly designed around causing absolute chaos like something akin to Goat Simulator.
                  You still can wreak havoc if you want, but the game is split into a collection of small environments with a checklist of things to complete.
                The starting section for example, the garden, has you dodging a groundskeeper while you do things like start the radio or turn on the sprinkler.
                 Sometimes the objectives are silly like stealing a little boy's glasses or dressing up a stone bust in someone's backyard.
                  There are some solutions that may take some tinkering to finally figure out, but every section is more clever than the last and I found myself completing almost the entire game in one sitting.
                The game is visually appealing with a really nice minimal style and the game is really easy to get the hang of. You literally only need to worry about moving, picking up various items with your beak,
                 occasionally consulting your checklist, and honking. I came into the game thinking it was going to be a little too simple, but I ended up really enjoying it.
                  It's also quite funny—even my girlfriend's 3-year-old nephew loves it.<br>
                And that's really all there is to say—play Untitled Goose Game. Even if you don't want to complete the collection of objectives,
                 just running around and causing havoc is a fun time. It's a game that basically exceeded all of my expectations.'- says one reviewer named Andrew wight.

                 Next review is by Lauren Weller who says '11/10, cackled the entire time I was playing. You can make so much mischief and interact with so many things
                in the game that you can go through things as fast or slow as you want. Not only are there listed objectives, but there's a secret list you can work
                on during the game that is revealed once you finish it the first time. It is worthy of all the hype it's getting. 
                The graphics aren't anything special, the controls are basic, but the music and game play mesh so well that you get so into stealing things or 
                running away from the humans, it really gets you emotionally invested. Then there's the big brain plays you need to make in order to complete some objectives and the sense of accomplishment you get when you successfully terrorize the inhabitants of this small village.'
